## Architecture

### Definitions and thesaurus entries

The endpoints for definitions and thesaurus entries are implemented using DRF Viewsets and
serializers and have logic limited to transforming the data as it's stored in the database into
the required format for the endpoint responses. These two endpoints return the "part of speech"
of words. The storage of the part of speech is different for definitions and thesaurus entries,
but a common "fields" module provides a `PartOfSpeechField` that both endpoints use from their
serializers, to ensure a common part of speech representation in responses for the two endpoints.

### Rhymes

The rhymes endpoint has a service layer to construct a complex raw SQL query to return the
rhymes for a word.

### Word of the day

The word of the day (wotd) endpoint has a service layer with some business logic:

- Minimal reimplementation of a random function, in order to have the same random results for
  a given seed as the word of the day feature provided by the
  [Android](https://github.com/caarmen/poet-assistant) and
  [iOS](https://github.com/caarmen/poet-assistant-ios) apps.
- Exclusion of too common or too rare words, based on a stem table in the database
